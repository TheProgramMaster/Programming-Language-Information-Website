# Programming Language Information Website

## Description

This is a website the user can execute 
on their local machine to record 
information pertaining to a list of 
programming languages, as well as a
secondary list of interesting facts
relevant to a second list of 
programming languages. This program
is to operate through parallel program
execution by executing two programs via
command line interface on the user's
local machine.

## Tools Used

This website was created using React.js
to design the front-end of this website,
as well as Django to design the backend
of this application. Django was used to
maintain a running list of articles on
two sections of the website. Namely,
this website includes one section that
allows the user to record a list of articles
of programming languages and their relevant
descriptions, as well as a second section
that allows the user to record a list of
articles and interesting facts about them.

follow these steps.

### Step 1

First download the zip file of this repository
and decompress the relevant .zip file to your

### Step 2

Open a command line interface window. Then
change directories into this .zip folder.
From here, change directories once more
into rouleTechWebsite to run the Django 
back-end server on your PC.
